💌 A Note From Me

I specialise in soft, romantic hairstyles and fresh, flawless makeup that enhances your features and feels completely “you.” On your wedding morning, my focus is entirely on the bride — creating a look that feels comfortable, confident, and lasts beautifully from the first photo to the final dance.

I now offer makeup exclusively for the bride, ensuring I can give you my full attention, keep the morning calm, and maintain a tidy, organised space. Your bridal party can still enjoy my hair styling services — perfect for bridesmaids, mothers of the bride or groom, and other special guests.

For bridal party makeup, I can arrange a trusted assistant at £65 per person — I take care of all the admin and pay them directly, so you only have one point of contact. Alternatively, you are welcome to book a separate makeup artist of your choice.

Bridal hair is my true niche and passion, and over the years I’ve honed my skills to create styles that are timeless, secure, and perfectly tailored to each individual.



When you’re ready to go ahead, please share:

Where you’ll be getting ready

When you are walking down the aisle

What time you would like to be ready by (take photography wishes into account)

How many people will be having hair (and makeup if applicable)

Whether you’d like a trial


I can then provide you with a personalised quote, provide the information on where to transfer the 25% deposit and also send across my T's and C's.

I look forward to hearing from you soon 💖
